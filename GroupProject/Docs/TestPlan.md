# Test Plan

## 1 Testing Strategy

### 1.1 Overall strategy

Regarding the test of this application, as an Android cryptogram deciphering game, on different testing granularities we will apply different test approaches. 

For Unit test level, i.e. for the isolated units, classes or modules testing, we will use the black-box testing, specifically the Category-Partition method as described in the lecture. For example, the checkIfCorrect() method should return the boolean value as expected (when the submission is correct, then return true; when submission is incorrect, return false), and raise error if it sees system breaking etc. We may also apply some of the white-box testing methods, because we will also look into the coding details of these modules to make sure they are implemented correctly.

Once we have finished the unit testing, on the integration test level, we can use the big-bang testing where all units are linked together and tested. It is hard to test the unit interface, isolate the error location, etc. so we may use other methods like bottom-up testing to find where the errors are and fix them.

On System testing level, we can use the model-based testing (e.g. Finite State Machine) for the functional testing. Specifically, we need to make sure that we 

1. Identify the independent testable features according to the specifications, and figure out the states in the model. 
1. All testable features/states/events/actions should be addresses at least once at a time in principle
1. Identify and select input/output cases around edge of partitions in the domain

For the nonfunctional testing, we need to check the reliablity, usability, maintainability etc in and after the development process. We will be building on Android platform using IntelliJ IDEA IDE, which will take care part of the reliability and maintainability test. As discussed in the "Design Document" file, we have defined a series of class, sequence, component, and deployment designs, and we will collaborate on Github for sharing and developing reliable and maintainable codes. The usability will be largely dependent on the UI design, and we will update it constantly as we go further in the implementation process.

For the Regression test, when updating the codes and change the system for certain functions, we need to re-verfiy that the update always meets our purpose and will not interfere with other untouched functions. 

In all the above analysis and core code development, everyone on team should be involved. Sihao Wang and Zhe Guang will work together to develop the quality assurance tests, conduct the tests and give feedback to the team.


### 1.2 Test Selection


We have discussed in the above session on what techniques we will be using on different granularity testing levels. Since we will use a well mixture of both black-box (category-partition, model-based, etc.) and white-box techniques (control flow testing, data flow testing, etc.), we will look at the product specification and codes details to find possible bugs and identify appropriate test cases. For all these different approaches applied on different granular levels, it is hard to give a universal description on how to select particular test cases, but generally for any of these different test levels/methods, we should try to make the test cases representative, that means:

1. Test cases should cover as many as possible different senarios/situations
1. Test cases should be efficient to implement-- the contraints to eliminate test redundancy are necessary
1. Appropriate degree of abstraction, good mixture of objective and subjective test method usages

Most of the details, dependent on the case/level of test, are already given above in the session 1.1, 


### 1.3 Adequacy Criterion

On the Unit test level, we are going to assess the quality of test cases based on the partition criterion. That means, all our cases should cover as most the partition edge conditions as possible. And at the same time we should eliminate repetative testing by introducing various constraints (property...if, single, error, etc). 

On Integration and System testing levels, the quality of test cases should be assessed by functional analysis. That means, with the mutual interactions among multiple modules being tested, we should make sure that every each module/state is tested, and as well their connections (functions/methods that link them, events that trigger them, results that returned from them). We need to have tests on every possible (even though returned erroneous) route/way, and try to avoid meaningless, redudant test cases. 

Even though the test cases will be mainly written by Zhe Guang and Sihao Wang, we will review all our test cases by each group member to better ensure quality on every granularity test level. 

### 1.4 Bug Tracking

Test and verify the software as much as possible to discover the bugs. Use independent cases to test each feature.
GitHub offers an efficient tracker of tasks, enhancements and bugs by the **Issues** function on its repository. A certain Issue can be tracked, mile-stoned, assigned and mentioned to anyone that's on team. A detailed description and the comment function will help update the status of the Issue, and enable every body to participate and contribute. So any enhancements (features, suggestions, questions, etc.) and detected bugs will be trackable and feasible to search through.


### 1.5 Technology

As covered in lecture and assignment, JUnit is very efficient in Unit test, and feasible through integration with Java and IntelliJ IDEA software. As we have seen before, JUnit is powerful (it provides various test method annotations e.g. @Test, @Before, @After; and it uses assertions for anticipated results, etc. ) and simple to use (in IntelliJ IDEA, it is almost automatic once the test cases are created, and results are clear where the failure/fault/bug is). Of course, we wouldn't limit ourselves by using JUnit only for Unit test (indeed there are cases where JUnit can be used for Integration test, etc).

Selenium is a great tool for Integration and System testing of web-based applications. It, being a light-weight tool as simple as a Firefox plugin, can support multiple language programminig such as Java and Python. And it supports mobile devices and various operating systems. Tests can be executed in parallel which is important when computability is of concern. Being a simple tool to use, Selenium also has some shortcomings that we need to resolve, e.g. the issues from lack of local native IDE (hard to access local data tables, export test data and generate test report, slower speed than local IDEs, limited parameterization support etc.). We will find other complementory tools to assist the testing if necessary.
